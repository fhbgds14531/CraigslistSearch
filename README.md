# CraigslistSearch
This software will scan craigslist in the area of the zipcode you give it and tell you how in demand coders are.
Yes, I know it's messy and probably pretty awful to read, but it's just something I threw together for the laughs.

To use: download and extract Binary.zip (https://goo.gl/6xmFtC) and run it from the command line ("java.exe -jar "CSearch.jar").

#####NOTE: If your zip code doesn't work, it may be because your city's craigslist page is based out of another city (e.g. the listings for Beverly Hills, CA [90210] are on the Los Angeles, CA [90001, 90002, etc] page).
